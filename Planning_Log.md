#### 2022.05.13
* 09:32 - Start passport and discord integration
* 14:25 - Been working all day to try and figure out Discord auth. I've been able to query discord and return the user. Finally overcame creating a user in my DB with the discordID and discord email. Still stuck on persisting the user through express-session with the use of a cookie. 
* 15:53 - Finally got the discord to properly auth a session, save a cookie locally, and store the session ID in MongoDB. This completes the ability to persist sessions across server reloads. FML
